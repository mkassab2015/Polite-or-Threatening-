# LLM Response Analysis Dataset Documentation

## Overview

This dataset contains responses from four Large Language Models (LLMs) - gpt-4o, gemini-2.5-pro, claude-sonnet-4, and deepseek-chat - to software engineering and ethical dilemma prompts delivered in two different tones: Polite and Threatening. The dataset was created to study how prompt tone affects LLM response characteristics across multiple linguistic dimensions.

**Dataset Size:** 480 observations  
**Models:** 4 LLMs (gpt-4o, gemini-2.5-pro, claude-sonnet-4, deepseek-chat)  
**Experimental Design:** Each prompt was presented in both polite and threatening tones to each model
